# FYP for Riley and Dylan



## Infinity
The first thing we need to do is work out a basic structure to our project. Here is a list of basic *talking points* we can consider.



- Definition
- Origin (Riley)
- Original use (or how it wasn't used)
- Modern application / dependencies
- Future Aplications


This is not necesarily the order in which may want to structure it, but the above ideas give a good foundational layer to build upon. For now, I am just going to start looking into the **Origin**. ( Riley )
