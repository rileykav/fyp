## Histor of Mathematics (ignore)


### Origin
Some of the most ancient mathematical texts originate during the time of
Meopotamia; and in particular their capital Babylon. Many early mathematical
proofs can be found in well documented clay tablets, conscribing
approximations for root 2, describing pythagoras' theorem (1000 years before
Pythagoros was born), an unorthodox base 60 numeral system and more.

Some interesting techniques used by Babylons include pre-calculated clay
tablets to assist with arthimitic. They would approximate non-trivial
reciprocals such as 1/13 ~= 7/91 ~= 7* 1/90 ...

Much of ancient mathematics revoloved around astronomy and lunar cycles
